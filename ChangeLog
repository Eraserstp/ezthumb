??: V2.1.0
  + introduced the safe mode
  + introduced the dual frame buffer

20120403:
  + ezthumb.c: improved twopass method after sanity test.
    Replace the scan mode with the safe mode

20120322:
  + ezthumb.c: reapply the twopass method

20120320:
  + ezthumb.c: introduced two frame buffers while decoding, one is the 
    current decoded frame and another one is the previous decoded frame.
    It could be useful while deciding the closest frames.

20120316:
  + main.c/ezthumb.c: introduced the safe mode as part of the -p option.

20120315: V2.0.1
  + main.c: fixed the '-p key' issue which caused by the profile
  + workaround for DVB rip file by this option:
    ezthumb -p scan --accurate --decode-otf Argus_20120222-114427384.ts

20120313:
  + video_duration(): there are two issues in this function. First the video
  header might be non-existed or inaccurate. In that case the video duration
  could be a redicules number. Using a bitrate threshold to workaround this
  problem. Second is that in the function avformat_seek_file(), the
  AVSEEK_FLAG_BYTE acts terrible (with middle.avi). Sometimes there is no way
  to seek to 90% of the video file so have to make a workabound.
 
20120214: V2.0.0
  + GUI mode added

20111214: V1.5.8
  + ezthumb.c, main.c: improved progress display for i-frame ripping by using
  DTS as the indicator

20111213:
  + ezthumb.c: verify the validation of the video file by checking its screen
  resolution and by opening the file.

20111204: V1.5.7
  + smm_signal_break.c: Fixed a bug that the custom signal callback was not
  hooked indeed.

20111125: FFMPEG version list
  + Finally found the culprit. There were two FFMPEG installs in my 
    ubuntu 10.10. One was 0.6.x. Another one appeared as 0.8.x. 
    By removing the latter the problem is gone.

Library:        libavformat  libavcodec  libavdevice  libavutil  libswscale  libavfilter
ffmpeg-0.6.1:   52.64.2      52.72.2     52.2.0       50.15.1    0.11.0      1.19.0
ffmpeg-0.6.3:   52.64.2      52.72.2     52.2.0       50.15.1    0.11.0      1.19.0
ffmpeg-0.7.8:   52.111.0     52.123.0    52.5.0       50.43.0    0.14.1      1.80.0
ubuntu 10.10:   52.64.2      52.72.2     52.2.0       50.15.1    0.11.0
ubuntu extra:   53.0.3       53.1.1      53.0.0       51.1.0     0.14.0



20111124:
  + I've got sick off the endless guess work about the FFMPEG's API version
    changes so I downloaded the 0.7.8 to revise the proper version macro.
    I believe most parts are fine except the av_dump_format(). There's no clue
    of when it was introduced.
  + Apparently the FFMPEG's APIChanges.txt has something wrong about the 
    version and avformat_open_input(). Defer to current FFMPEG lib
  + Made up the missing freetype6.dll in the Windows release

20111123: V1.5.6
  + Merged partly from guidev about the LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION macro to 
    make the makefile workable in archlinux, ubuntu 10.10 and mingw
  + Implemented a simple build-in profile.

20111122: 
  + Release tag: RELEASE_1_5_5
  + All .a files were missing under the mswin/ directory because of the 
    wrong setting of the .gitignore file. Now retrieved them.

20111115: V1.5.5 
  + Integrated other libraries into the mswin branch so they could 
    be managed by git
  + Revisioned the makefile for MinGW

20111104:
  + Revisioned this project in MinGW and made it workable in MS Windows
  + Fixed the conditional compiling error for the FFMPEG version control

20111021: V1.5.4
  + merged the id_*.c into id_lookup.c
  + slightly adjusted the Makefile

20111021: V1.5.3
  + Release tag: RELEASE_1_5_3
  + Merge two branches into the new version for release

20111021: V1.5.2
  + Supported the maximum number when ripping the key frames
    Command line now support the '-p key@N' opion

20111007: V1.5.2
  + Added a rectify function in video_snapshot_skim() to speed up the
    doing in the unseekable media files.
  + Refined the video_find_stream() so it could also support 0.6.3 ffmpeg

20111006: V1.5.1
  + Fixed a bug of finding the video stream, now using av_find_best_stream().
  + Added the signal handler. Now ezthumb can be broken in the middle.

20111001: V1.5.0
  Make fixes and ready for release

20110908: V1.4.2
  Displaying the screen shot method has been moved into video_snap_begin()

20110908: V1.4.1
  heuristic method is ready for test.

20110906: V1.4.0
  Many codes regroups in recent day. Begin with a thought that reducing 
  scan passes if video file doesn't support backward seek. I roughly
  have got an idea of a heuristic method. Hope it can be done in 1.4.1

20110831:
  + ezthumb.c: a little bit speed up of the video_duration() function

20110830: V1.3.3
  + ezthumb.c: duration structure changed

20110829:
  + main.c: '--index' option and adjust the '-i', '-S' and '-I' options
  + ezthumb.c: fixed the bug about no video stream issue
  + LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MAJOR: is used to control the depreciated APIs
  - BUGGY: the "APIchanges" in FFMPEG has error in av_open_input_file() so
    the version number is not correct about this
    function.

20110824: V1.3.2
  + eznotify.c: fixed a bug that calling the eznotify() with null pointer

20110821: V1.3.1
  + main.c: add '-I' option and move av_log_set_level() to main()
  + ezthumb.c: video_seek_available() fixed a bug that desn't rewind the video
    stream when this function failed.
  - A problem: if the video clip is shorted than it claimed, the output would
    be nasty

20110820: V1.3
  + ezthumb.c: fixed the buggy video_ms_to_pts() and video_system_to_pts()

20110819: merged change from 1.2.2, the '--outdir' option
  + main.c: add command line option "--linear" to indicate the ezthumb
    to walk through the whole video rather than using av_seek_frame()
    Change command line option "--opt-key" to "--anyframe"

20110818: pre V1.3
  + main.c: use a generic event_cb() to handle all notifications.
  + eznotify.c: generic module to handle all notifications.
  + ezthumb.c: isolated the functions to generate thumbnails to:
    video_save_scan_pass(), video_save_quick_pass()
    The problem comes with some .wmv files which could not apply 
    av_seek_frame(). The solution is to walk through the whole video from
    first packet to the last.

20110302:
  + main.c: add command line options to set up colours and font size.

20110301:
  + ezthumb.c: fix the coredump if using still images as input sources.

20110227: V1.2
  + support setting the starting and the ending time position
  + add a status line to the bottom of the canvas

20110223: V1.1
  + support the animated GIF
  + support the transparent background
