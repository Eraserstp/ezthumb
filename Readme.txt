What is it
==========

Ezthumb is used to create thumbnails for video files. It uses the FFMPEG 
library as its engine so it almost supports any video formats. 
Normally the screenshots would be gridded into a single canvas picture or 
compose a single GIF animation file.  But it can also save frames separately.
The output format could be JPG, PNG, GIF or GIF animation, where PNG and GIF 
supports the transparent background. Batch processing allows.

This program was inspired by movie thumbnailer (mtn):
http://sourceforge.net/projects/moviethumbnail/


Install
=======

Ezthumb requires following packages:

ffmpeg
gd
freetype
bzip2

You may need to modify the Makefile, especially the INCDIR and LIBDIR macros,
to point to proper directories.



MinGW
=====

Make.conf setting:

SYSTOOL = mingw
SYSAPI  = CFG_WIN32_API

FFmpeg Win32 shared build by Kyle Schwarz from Zeranoe's:
http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/

Following Libraries were grabbed from GnuWin:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/

gd-2.0.33-1
jpeg-6b-4
libiconv-1.9.2-1
libpng-1.2.37
zlib-1.2.3


Examples
========

You may use the command as simple as this to test it: 

ezthumb *.avi

However, the most used command would include a grid setting and a size setting:

ezthumb -g 4x8 -s 33% *.avi

It will generate the 4x8 thumbnails for all .avi files in the current 
directory. Each screen shots inside the thumbnails are 33% of the video frame
in width and height.

This command can list the useful information of video files:

ezthumb -i *.avi

Please see the manpage for more examples.
