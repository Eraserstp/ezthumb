What is it
==========

Ezthumb is used to create thumbnails for video files. It uses the FFMPEG 
library as its engine so it almost supports any video formats. 
Normally the screenshots would be gridded into a single canvas picture or 
compose a single GIF animation file.  But it can also save frames separately.
The output format could be JPG, PNG, GIF or GIF animation, where PNG and GIF 
supports the transparent background. Supported batch processing with logarithm
curve profiles.


Release Notes
=============
Version 3.6.4:
*) Fixed the bug which freeze the progress bar in i-frame dumping mode.
*) Fixed the bug in configure file to the correct linking sequence.
*) Fixed the bug which failed to hightlight the "RUN" button when media files 
   were loaded from the command line.
*) Improved the user input by verifying the content in the text controls.
*) Added the support of TrueType fonts in Windows.
   Note that the libgd uses fontconfig to translate the font faces to the font
   files. In Windows however there's no fontconfig available so libgd could not
   find the proper font files. Unfortunately there's also no out-of-box APIs to
   directly translate the font faces to the font files in Windows. My approach 
   is to enumerate all registered font faces and to compare them with all 
   registered true type fonts. It's still imperfect but around 95% fonts would 
   be matched.

Version 3.6.3 quick release:
*) Fixed the bug which failed to save the transparent screenshots in GUI.
*) Fixed the linking sequence issue between libiup and libX11.

Install
=======

Ezthumb requires the following packages:

ffmpeg
gd
gtk2 (in X-window)
freetype
libpng
libjpeg
bzip2

Most systems have already installed those libraries so normally you only need
to install the development files of ffmpeg/gd/gtk2.

*) CentOS 5/6/7 or similar version Fedora/RHEL

$ sudo yum install ffmpeg-devel gd-devel gtk2-devel

then

$ make

*) CentOS 4 or similar version Fedora/RHEL

Current version IUP is not compatible with CentOS 4 so Ezthumb has to disable
the GUI interface. What's more, ezthumb could not generate GIF animation 
thumbnails because the old version of libgd.

$ sudo yum install ffmpeg-devel gd-devel
$ export SYSGUI=CFG_GUI_OFF

then

$ make


*) Windows and MinGW

The ezthumb has been shipped with a library bundle in which all necessary 
libraries are included. You don't need to download anything to build ezthumb.
Just go to the ezthumb directory in MinGW console and type:

make

it will build two execute files, ezthumb.exe for command line and the GUI
frontend ezthumb_win.exe. You may need to use

make install_win

to collect all required DLL files into one directory for easy releasing.
If you have Nullsoft Installer (NSIS) installed, you may use

make release

to generate an install file.

Examples
========

You may use the command as simple as this to test it: 

ezthumb *.avi

It will generate thumbnails for all .avi files by the default profile.
Another common usage is including a grid setting and a size setting:

ezthumb -g 4x8 -s 33% *.avi

It will generate the 4x8 thumbnails for all .avi files in the current 
directory. Each screen shots inside the thumbnails are 33% of the video frame
in width and height.

This command can list the useful information of video files:

ezthumb -i *.avi

Please see the manpage for more examples.
