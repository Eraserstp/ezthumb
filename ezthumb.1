.SH NAME
ezthumb \- generate thumbnails of video clips
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ezthumb
.RI [ options ]
.I video_clips...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ezthumb
is used to create thumbnails for video files. It uses the 
.SM FFMPEG 
library as its engine so 
.B ezthumb
almost supports any video formats.
Normally the screenshots would be tiled into a single canvas picture or 
compose a single 
.B GIF animation 
file.  But it can also save frames separately.
The output format could be 
.B JPG, PNG, GIF 
or 
.B GIF animation
, where 
.B PNG 
and 
.B GIF 
supports the transparent background. Batch processing allows.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-c , " \-\-colour \fIMI:TM:BG\fP"
Specify the colour of text and canvas. 
.I MI
is the colour of the media information text.
.I TM
is the colour of the inset time stamp and
.I BG
is the canvas' background colour. These colour codes use the same form of
.B RRGGBB
which is composed by Red, Green and Blue. The
.B RRGGBB
must be set by 6 hexadecimal number to make sure the colour won't go wrong,
for example:
.I 0f55f0.

.TP
.BR \-d , " \-\-during \fIhead\fP"
Specify the method to retrieve the duration of videos. Normally the duration can be
retrieved from the container head, which is the default mode
.B "head" .
However, some dodgy files were broken or included the inaccurate duration value.
As an alternative the duration could be retrieved by
.B "scan"
mode.
.B ezthumb
would scan the whole video file to locate the last packet. It is accurate but slow.
The compromise mode is 
.B "fast" ,
which only scans the tail part of the video.
.TP
.BR \-e , " \-\-edge \fIvalue\fP"
This option defines the thickness of the black edge around each screenshots.
The default value 0 means these's no black edge around screenshots.

.TP
.BR \-f , " \-\-font \fIfilename\fP"
This option specifies the full path of a TrueType font which is used to
render the media information and timestamp in the output picture. If this
option is not specified, the program will use the internal fix-pixel fonts.
Note that the fontconfig patterns is also acceptable.

.TP
.BR \-F , " \-\-fontsize \fIMI:TM\fP"
This option is used to set the pointsize of the font. 
.B MI
is for the text size of the media information and 
.B TM
is for the size of time stamps inside the screen shots.

.TP
.BR \-g , " \-\-grid \fIcolumn x row\fP"
This option is used to define the grid of the screenshots in the canvas. 
The default value
.I "4x4"
means it is a 4 columns by 4 rows thumbnail canvas. 
Therefore it would take 16 screen shots in total. 
The time intervals between each shots would be calculated by the duration
of the video and the total shots. It could be tuned by 
.BR "\-\-timestep" ,
.BR "\-\-time\-from" ,
.BR "\-\-time\-end" ,
.BR "\-\-opt\-ffr" ,
and
.BR "\-\-opt\-lfr"
options.

.B Note
that there are two
.B tricky
modes. If 
.I column
is 0, 
.B ezthumb
will separately save screenshots into the number of
.I row
files. If
.I row
is also 0,
.B ezthumb
will save all key frames (I-frame) into separate files. 
So watch out, it may be hundreds.

.TP
.BR \-i , " \-\-list"
Display the general information of media files in the list form. 
This option won't generate any pictures.

.TP
.BR \-I , " \-\-info"
Display the media information. This option won't generate any pictures.

.TP
.BR  \-m , " \-\-format \fIpicture_format\fP"
This option is used to define the output format. 
.B ezthumb
support three formats:
.I jpg, gif
and
.I png.
The
.I jpg
can be followed by an identifier
.I @
and a quality factor. For example, the default format is
.I jpg@85 .
The
.I gif
format can also be followed by a factor. In that case, it means to generate an
.B animated GIF 
file. The factor is the interval in millisecond between each frames. 
For example,
.I gif@1000
means to generate the animated GIF file from the screenshots and the interval
between frames is 1 second.

.TP
.BR \-o , " \-\-outdir \fIdirectory\fP"
Specify a
.I directory
for storing the output thumbnail files.

.TP
.BR \-p , " \-\-process \fImethod\fP"



.TP
.BR \-s , " \-\-ssize \fIthumbnail_size\fP"
Specify the dimension of each thumbnail. There are two methods to describe the
dimension. One is setting the width and height explicitly like
.I "160x120".
Another one is setting a zoom ratio like
.I "50%".
In that case the thumbnail would be 50% of the original frame size, such as
160x120 thumbnail from a 320x240 video. 

.B Note
that this option would be overriden by the
.BR \-w
option. If the
.BR \-w
was not specified, the dimension of the canvas would be summed up by the 
dimension of thumbnail, the grid measurement and the gaps between thumbnails.
However, if the
.BR \-w
option was specified, the width of each thumbnails is deducted from the 
canvas width and gap size. The height of each thumbnails is calculated by
the aspect ratio.
.TP
.BR \-t , " \-\-timestep \fImillisecond\fP"
Specify the time interval between each screen shots in millisecond.
If this option was not specified, 
.BR ezthumb
would calculate the average interval by the duration of the video and 
the number of screen shots.
.TP
.BR \-v , " \-\-verbose"
Output verbose information.
.TP
.BR \-w , " \-\-width \fIsize_in_pixel\fP"
Specify the whole width of the thumbnail canvas in pixel. This option would
override the 
.BR \-s
option and the width of each thumbnails is deducted from the canvas width 
and gap size. The height of each thumbnails is calculated by the aspect ratio.
.TP
.BR \-x , " \-\-suffix \fIstring\fP"
Set the suffix of the generated file name. For example, if a video clip names
.I myvideo.avi
and the default option is
.I "_thumb",
the generated thumbnail picture file name would be
.I myvideo_thumb.avi.

.TP
.BR "\-\-accurate"
disable the key-frame-only mode. The default behaviour of
.B ezthumb
is taking screen shots in the nearest key frame (I-Frame). 
It is quick but inaccurate towards the specified place. With this option,
.B ezthumb
would take screen shots in all kinds of frames,  I-Frame or P-Frame, 
It is accurate in time but slow and sometimes takes pictures within 
.B "ghost shadow".
.B NOTE
that if the
.B time step
is less than 10 seconds, it automatically changes into the
.I off
mode.

.TP
.BR " \-\-background \fIfilename\fP"
Load a background picture for the thumbnail canvas. It supports
.B JPG
and
.B PNG
format. The background picture is placed in the canvas center by default.
To adjust this, see 
.BR \-\-pos\-bg
option for the details.

.TP
.BR "\-\-gap\-shots \fIsize_of_gap\fP"
define the gap size between each thumbnail. The size can be defined by pixel 
size or by percentage of the thumbnail width. For example,
.I "\-\-gap\-shots 4"
means the gap of 4 pixels between each screen shots, but
.I "\-\-gap\-shots 4%"
means the gap is 4% of of the width of a single screen shot.

.TP
.BR "\-\-gap\-margin \fIsize_of_margin\fP"
define the margin size around the thumbnail canvas. The size can be defined 
by pixel size or by percentage of the thumbnail width. For example,
.I "\-\-gap\-margin 4"
means to keep 4 pixels blank in the margin, but
.I "\-\-gap\-margin 4%"
means the margin is 4% of the width of a single screen shot.

.TP
.BR "\-\-opt\-info \fIon|off\fP"
enable or disable displaying the media information in the head part of the
thumbnail canvas. The default is
.I on.

.TP
.BR "\-\-opt\-time \fIon|off\fP"
enable or disable displaying the timestamp in each screen shots. The default is
.I on.

.TP
.BR "\-\-opt\-ffr \fIon|off\fP"
enable or disable taking screen shots from the first frame. The default is
.I off
because most videos start from a black screen.

.TP
.BR "\-\-opt\-lfr \fIon|off\fP"
enable or disable taking screen shots to the last frame. The default is
.I off
because most videos end to a black screen.

.TP
.BR "\-\-pos\-bg \fIposition_code ( : qualification )\fP"
define the position of the background picture. The default setting is
.I mc.
.br
See 
.B POSITION CODES
for the details.

.TP
.BR "\-\-pos\-time \fIposition_code\fP"
define the position of the timestamp inside the screenshots. 
The default setting is
.I rt.
.br
See 
.B POSITION CODES
for the details.

.TP
.BR "\-\-pos\-info \fIposition_code\fP"
define the position of the media information. The default setting is
.I lt.
Note that the media information can only be placed in the head area
of the canvas. 
.br
See
.B POSITION CODES
for the details.

.TP
.BR "\-\-time\-from \fIstarting_time\fP"
define the starting time position where the 
.B ezthumb
would start to take shoots. The default setting is the head of the video.
The time position can be defined as explicit as 
.I HH:MM:SS 
and 
.I HH:MM:SS:MS.
It also can be defined as the percentage of the video length like 
.I 33%
etc. Note that the
.BR "\-\-opt\-ffr
and 
.BR "\-\-opt\-lfr
options are still applicable with this option.

.TP
.BR "\-\-time\-end \fIending_time\fP"
define the ending time position where the 
.B ezthumb
would stop taking shoots. The default setting is the end of the video.
The time position can be defined as explicit as 
.I HH:MM:SS 
and 
.I HH:MM:SS:MS.
It also can be defined as the percentage of the video length like 
.I 33%
etc. Note that the
.BR "\-\-opt\-ffr
and 
.BR "\-\-opt\-lfr
options are still applicable with this option.

.TP
.BR " \-\-transparent"
Specify the transparent background. Note that only
.B PNG
and
.B GIF
support the transparent background.

.TP
.BR "\-\-linear"
enforce the
.B ezthumb
to take screen shots by walking through the video file linearly. 
The default behaviour of 
.B ezthumb
is to seek to the closest video frame to take the snapshot.
However, some video format doesn't support the random seek so the workaround
is scanning the whole video file and taking snapshots at right places. The
.B ezthumb
would swith to this mode automatically if the seeking function failed.
User can also explicitly specify this option to enforce the 
.I linear 
mode.

.TP
.BR "\-\-vindex \fIvideo_stream_index\fP"
specify the video stream index number inside the container file.
The default behaviour of
.B ezthumb
is taking screen shots from the first video stream it has met.
This option could override it and take screen shots from any stream.
The stream indexes can be found by 
.BR "\-i"
or
.BR "\-I"
option.

.SH POSITION CODES
Position codes are used to describe the object position in the target image.
There are ten position codes:
.TP
.BR lt
set the object to the left top corner
.TP
.BR lc
set the object to the left center side
.TP
.BR lb
set the object to the left bottom corner
.TP
.BR mt
set the object to the middle top side
.TP
.BR mc
set the object to the middle center
.TP
.BR mb
set the object to the middle bottom side
.TP
.BR rt
set the object to the right top corner
.TP
.BR rc
set the object to the right center side
.TP
.BR rb
set the object to the right bottom side
.TP
.BR tt
tile the object
.PP
For the background picture, the position code can be followed by a 
qualification code:
.TP
.BR st
stretch to fit the whole canvas
.TP
.BR ex
enlarge to fit the width of the canvas. The picture keeps its orignal ratio.
.TP
.BR ey
enlarge to fit the height of the canvas. The picture keeps its orignal ratio.
.TP
.BR sx
stretch the width of the picture to fit the canvas but keep its height same.
.TP
.BR sy
stretch the height of the picture to fit the canvas but keep its width same.

.SH EXAMPLES
